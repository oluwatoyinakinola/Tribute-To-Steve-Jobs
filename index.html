      <p> I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones
        i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and an
        awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work with
        the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs
        way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs
        he`s a great man and i will never forget him.</p>

      <h6>Steve Jobs</h6>
      <p> what impact has steve jobs had on my life? Every short story i`ve written
        as an adult and certainly every one that has been published, almost every
        email i`ve ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple,
        i interacted online using an Apple machine long before i encountered a PC,
        Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future i dreamed of when i was a
        kid. And though his vision, i have been able to realize my own. You will be
        missed, Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>

      <h6>He`s gone...</h6>

      <p> A part of my heart was cracked, I didn`t know him personally but i felt like
        i knew him, I will forever remember him. I`m still saddened because he was taken
        too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.

      <h6>I will always remember Steve</h6>
      <p> Dear Steve family, dear Apple company i can`t find words to describe
        my feelings. For me Apple means alot. I got a good job using Apple
        products, I have found a new lifestyle using Apple. And of course, I`ve
        been admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected
        with Steve. I do hope he`ll be remembered around the world as a genius.
